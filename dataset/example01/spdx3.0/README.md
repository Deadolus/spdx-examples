# Example 01

## Description

An example of a simple dataset in tabular format.

```text
content
├── codebook.csv
└── data.csv
```

Both `codebook.csv` and `data.csv` are plain text files in CSV (comma-separated
values) format.

The file `data.csv` contains records of gas emission data for each year in a
country. It has a header on the first line that defines the column names.
Each record consists mostly of numerical data with some categorical data.

The file `codebook.csv` contains the column names from the header of
`data.csv`, together with their description, unit, and source.
